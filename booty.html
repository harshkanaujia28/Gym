                    Make sure to keep your core engaged throughout the exercise – this will help you maintain control
                    throughout the movement.
                    Keep your head and neck in a neutral position – looking up or down can put unnecessary strain on
                    these areas.
                    Avoid arching your back.
                    Don’t let your knees cave in as you’re driving upward – they should stay in line with your hips and
                    shoulders throughout the movement.
                    Don’t use momentum to get the bar up – always have control over the lift.

                    The RDL (Romanian Dead Lift) exercise will help build strength in the player’s lower back, glutes,
                    and hamstrings. These muscle groups are where a lot of the jumping power comes from, especially when
                    jumping off two feet. So this Romanian Dead Lift exercise is perfect for improving a player’s
                    vertical jump and explosiveness. It is going to isolate those 3 muscle groups and really work on
                    developing strength.

                    To begin this exercise place your front foot on a step while balancing on the ball of your rear foot as demonstrated.

Lower yourself into a deep lunge position by bending your back knee. Try to keep a parallel alignment between your trunk and front shin bone. To avoid straining your hips, only drop down as far as comfortable. Return to the start position, by pushing up through the heel of your front foot.

Your physiotherapist will advise whether you should perform this exercise with any weights.
